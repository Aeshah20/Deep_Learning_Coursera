Assume that there are 2 happy people and 2 unhappy people in a room. Concretely, persons A and B are happy and persons C and D are unhappy. 
If you were to randomly pick a person from the room, what is the probability that the person is happy.?
is correct 1/2 

Assume that there are 2 happy people and 2 unhappy people in a room. Concretely, persons A and B are happy and persons C and D are unhappy. 
If a friend showed you the part of the room where the two happy people are, what is the probability that you choose person B?
is correct 1/2 

From the equations presented below, express the probability of a tweet being positive given that it contains the word happy in terms
of the probability of a tweet containing the word happy given that it is positive?
is correct P( Positive ∣ "happy" )=P("happy" ∣ Positive )× P( "happy")P( Positive )
​
Bayes rule is defined as?
is correct P(X∣Y)=P(Y∣X)×P(Y)/P(X)

Suppose that in your dataset, 25% of the positive tweets contain the word ‘happy’. 
You also know that a total of 13% of the tweets in your dataset contain the word 'happy', 
and that 40% of the total number of tweets are positive. You observe the tweet: ''happy to learn NLP'.
What is the probability that this tweet is positive? (Please, round your answer up to two decimal places. Remember that 0.578 = 0.58 and 0.572 = 0.57)?
is correct 0.77
