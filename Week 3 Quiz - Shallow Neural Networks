Week 3 Quiz - Shallow Neural Networks

Given a corpus A, encoded as( 123) and corpus B encoded as (472) and corpus B encoded as?
is correct 5.91608

Given the previous problem, a user now came up with a corpus C defined as (341) and you want to recommend a document that is similar to it. Would you recommend document A or document B?
is correct Document A

What is the range of a cosine similarity score, namely s,  in the case of information retrieval where the vectors are positive?
is correct 0≤s≤1

The cosine similarity score of corpus A =(1 0 1) and corpus B = (2 8 1 ) is equal to? 
is correct 
0.08512565307587486

Please select all that apply. PCA is 
1- used to reduce the dimension of your data;
2- visualize word vectors;

Please select all that apply. Which is correct about PCA?
1- You can think of an eigenvector as an uncorrelated feature for your data.
2- The eigenvalues tell you the amount of information retained by each feature.
3- Computing the covariance matrix is critical when performing PCA

In which order do you perform the following operations when computing PCA?
is correct mean normalize, get Σ the covariance matrix, perform SVD, then dot product the data, namely X, with a subset of the columns of U to get the reconstruction of your data. 


Vector space models allow us to 
1- To represent words and documents as vectors. 
2- build useful applications including and not limited to, information extraction, machine translation, and chatbots. 
3- create representations that capture similar meaning.
